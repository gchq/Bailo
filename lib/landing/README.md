## Local development

### Requirements

- Node v24

### Development Build

In order to start the application locally for development/testing, you will need to run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i
# This copies over some components/files from the frontend to be re-used
npm run generate
# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

You can then access the site by going to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:3000).
