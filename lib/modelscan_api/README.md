# ModelScan

This directory provides all of the necessary functionality to interact with
[modelscan](https://github.com/protectai/modelscan/tree/main) as a REST API.

> ModelScan is an open source project from
> [Protect AI](https://protectai.com/?utm_campaign=Homepage&utm_source=ModelScan%20GitHub%20Page&utm_medium=cta&utm_content=Open%20Source)
> that scans models to determine if they contain unsafe code. It is the first model scanning tool to support multiple
> model formats. ModelScan currently supports: H5, Pickle, and SavedModel formats. This protects you when using PyTorch,
> TensorFlow, Keras, Sklearn, XGBoost, with more on the way.
