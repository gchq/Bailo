# Integration test files

Simple, minimal test files for use with `pytest -m integration`. These files may contain "malicious" code which is
specifically chosen to actually be safe to run while having the footprint of dangerous code.

Test files can be regenerated by running `python3 generate_test_data.py`.

## safe.pkl

Simply stores `{"foo": "bar"}`.

## unsafe.pkl

A "malicious" pickle file which executes the system command `echo hello world` when loaded, as well as storing
`{"foo": "bar"}`.
