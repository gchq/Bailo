# Helm Deployments

> At the moment `helm/bailo` is configured for OpenShift deployment, our default deployment target. Support for
> Kubernetes is on the way. We have heard that external organisations have had success already by disabling 'routes' and
> setting 'ingresses' instead.

## Requirements

- [HELM CLI](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases)
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

### Optional

OC is required for deployments to OpenShift

- [OpenShift CLI](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/oc/latest/linux/oc.tar.gz)

## Deployment

### Setup

All commands assume they are run in the `helm/bailo` directory. The user should have already authenticated `kubectl` to
their cluster and changed to the correct context:

1. `kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=bailo`

To deploy to `OpenShift`, `oc` must also be configured correctly.

### Configuration

Deployment options can be overridden by including a `--values <file containing overrides>` to a Helm command, or by
using `--set <option>=<value>`.

We do not host built images of Bailo, thus at the very minimum the configuration should include the location of a Bailo
image:

```
---
image:
  repository: some.repository.com/bailo
  tag: 'latest'
```

This image can be built with `docker build -t bailo .` in the root directory. This guide assumes the overrides file is
called `local.yaml` in the `helm/bailo` folder.

#### Installing Bailo

1. `helm dependency update`
2. `helm install --values ./local.yaml bailo .`
3. `helm list # list current deployments`

#### Upgrading Bailo

1. `helm upgrade --values ./local.yaml bailo .`

#### Removing Bailo

1. `helm uninstall bailo`
