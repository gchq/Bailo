# Authentication

Bailo is intended to be run in multiple different environments, each of which will have their own standard
authentication and authorisation methods. To enable this, Bailo exposes a class of methods that can be overridden to
integrate with various services.

By default, we expect the Bailo instance to be run behind a reverse proxy, which sets the following headers to identify
users and their roles:

- `x-userid` is a unique identifier for a user.
- `x-email` is an optional email address (to send notifications).
- `x-user` is a JSON encoded object containing any other user data.

Within Nginx, these can be set via the `proxy_set_header` declaration:

```bash
proxy_set_header X-UserId "user";
proxy_set_header X-Email "user@example.com";
proxy_set_header X-User '{"some":"data"}';
```

To support other authentication mechanisms, an administrator can override the `getUserFromReq` method to get this
information from any other method. To do this edit `server/external/Authorisation.ts` to override the required methods
from `server/utils/AuthorisationBase.ts`. E.g.

```javascript
// server/external/Authorisation.ts
import AuthorisationBase from '../utils/AuthorisationBase'
import { Request } from 'express'

class Authorisation extends AuthorisationBase {
  async getUserFromReq(_req: Request) {
    const username = req.get('x-username')

    return {
      userId: username,
      email: await getUserEmail(username),
      data: await getUserData(username),
    }
  }
}

export default Authorisation
```

In the above example, instead of getting this data from headers passed into the application, we now get the username
from headers and get the users email and data from another method.

This is called on each request and not cached, so you may want to implement this yourself if you are using expensive
cryptographic functions or making external network requests.

# Authorisation

By default Bailo protects models from deployment by requiring an approval by the model owner. Also, only the model owner
is capable of editting a model that has been uploaded. All users can view all models uploaded to the system.

This is unlikely to be suitable for large organisations, who may wish to integrate their own internal authorisation
system into Bailo. An administrator can integrate with their internal authorisation system by overriding one of the
`canUserSeeX` functions, visible in `server/utils/AuthorisationBase.ts`. Each functino takes in a user object, as well
as the object to view. The function is then expected to return either `true` or `false` depending on if the user can
view that object.

This authorisation affects both users directly viewing a model, as well as the models visible in the marketplace.

An example authorisation implemention:

```javascript
// server/external/Authorisation.ts
import AuthorisationBase from '../utils/AuthorisationBase'
import { UserDoc } from '../models/User'
import { VersionDoc } from '../models/Version'

class Authorisation extends AuthorisationBase {
  async getUserFromReq(_req: Request) {
    // we now include roles in the user object
    return {
      userId: 'user',
      data: { roles: ['alpha', 'beta', 'gamma'] },
    }
  }

  async canUserSeeVersion(user: UserDoc, model: VersionDoc) {
    // we can access the roles from the user document
    const userRoles = user.data.roles
    // our schema has a 'role' field we need users to have to see it
    const versionRole = version.metadata.authorisation.role

    // check if the user has the required role
    const canAccess = userRoles.includes(versionRole))

    return canAccess
  }
}

export default Authorisation
```

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
