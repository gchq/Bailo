# Developer Notes

A quick list of things that developers think of when coding.

- Never use `console.log` on the server, always use `logger` from utils.
- Always run `npm run build` to check your types are valid across the project.
- Don't run `npm run build` and `npm run dev` simultaneously.
- VS: Code TypeScript messing around? Try `Ctrl + Shift + P` -> `Typescript: Restart TS Server`
- Never respond with status codes, instead `throw BadReq` and let the error handler sort it.

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
