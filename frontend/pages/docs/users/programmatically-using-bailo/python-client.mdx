[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/bailo/).

**You can find the full Python documentation [here](../../python/index.html).**

## Installation

```bash
pip install bailo
```

## Why use the Python Client?

The Python client integrates cleanly with Python tooling and is ideal for:

- Notebooks and experimentation
- Automation and scripting
- Integrating Bailo into ML workflows

### Scripting and Automation

This Python Client provides a better way to add additional Bailo functionality to projects.

### Using Bailo with MLflow

Optional extras are provided for integration with [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/ml/).

pip install bailo[mlflow]
```

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
