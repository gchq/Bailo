# Python Client

Bailo also provides a wrapper for all endpoints in the form of a Python Client. It is now available on the Python
Package Index.

**You can find the full Python documentation [here](../../python/index.html)**

Install the Python Client with:

> ```bash
> pip install bailo
> ```

## Why would I want to use this instead of the Webpage?

This python package is specifically designed to integrate with Python's tools and packages. This is ideal for using
pretrained models in your notebooks, data analysis, automation or scripting.

### Scripting and Automation

This Python Client provides a better way to add additional Bailo functionality to projects.

### Using ML Tools with Bailo

This package allows you to work with ML tools for example MLFlow for experiment tracking.
