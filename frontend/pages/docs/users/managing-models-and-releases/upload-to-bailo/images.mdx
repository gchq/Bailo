# Uploading docker images

Bailo uses a Docker registry to store container images associated with models. Unlike files, Docker images are
**model‑specific**: you push an image to a model first, and then explicitly attach it to one or more releases.

## Pushing an image to a model

To push a Docker image to Bailo, navigate to your model and open the **Registry** tab. This tab provides step‑by‑step
instructions tailored to your model and registry.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='instructions on how to push image to model' src={bailoPushImage} />
</Box>

## Adding an image to a release

Once the image has been successfully pushed to Bailo’s registry, it becomes available to attach to a release.

Edit an existing release or create a new one, then select the image from the available list.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='release being edited with new image attached' src={bailoImageRelease} />
</Box>

## What is a Docker container?

In the context of Bailo, a Docker container is an isolated, self‑contained application environment used to run a model.
Packaging models as containers allows them to be started quickly, run consistently across environments, and used for
inference without additional setup.
