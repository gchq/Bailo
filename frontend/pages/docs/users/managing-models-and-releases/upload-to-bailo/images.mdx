# Uploading docker images

Bailo uses a docker registry to store images of models. Unlike files, docker images are model specific; meaning that you
upload them to a model and then add them to a release.

## Pushing a model to Bailo

You can push a model to Bailo by following the instructions in the registry tab of your model.

<MigrationImageBehaviour src={bailoPushImage} />

## Adding an image to a release

Once your image has been pushed to Bailo's registry you can now add it to one of your releases.

<MigrationImageBehaviour src={bailoImageRelease} />

## What is a docker container?

In the context of bailo, a docker container is an isolated application or service that can be used to run your models
from. This makes models easier to work with as models can just be 'spun-up' and inferenced from.
