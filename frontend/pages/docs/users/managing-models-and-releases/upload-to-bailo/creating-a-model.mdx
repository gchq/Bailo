## **Bailo Marketplace**

The models added to Bailo are displayed in the Bailo Marketplace.

<Box sx={{ margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image src={bailoMarketIcon} height={550} />
</Box>

This enables the models to be discoverable to other users. There is an exception to this, where the models are marked as
private. In these instances the model will not be displayed.

## **Finding models**

Models are discoverable by the search functionality or via filtering on the tags.

## **Adding a model to the Marketplace**

New models can be added to Bailo using the the **_Add a new model_** button on the Marketplace, or alternatively, the
**_Add Model_** button at the top of the application.

Adding models to the Marketplace is quick and easy and requires three fields to be completed.

The fields are:

- **_*The Model Name and the Model Description.*_**

These represent what is displayed for the model in the Marketplace.

- The 3rd field that requires completion is the **_*Public*_** or **_*Private*_** option.

Public models are available for everyone, whereas private models will only be visible if you have been given the right
permissions in the model settings.

The model is now added to the Marketplace.

## **Adding the Model Card detail**

Once the initial three fields have been completed and the model is added to the Marketplace, the user is provided with
the option to select which **_*schema*_** they wish to use.

- The selection of the schema defines the model card structure that will be required for the model.

- The model card provides various details about a model, including what it is intended for, what training and testing
  has been undertaken and potential biases.

- The model card detail can evolve as and when the information is known / available.

## Changing the Model Name or Description

To change model name or description, select the model and go to **_*Settings'*_** and amend the **_*Name*_** and / or
**_*Description*_**.
