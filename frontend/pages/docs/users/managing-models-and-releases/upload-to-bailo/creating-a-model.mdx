# Bailo Marketplace

Models added to Bailo are displayed in the **Bailo Marketplace**, where they can be discovered and reused by other
users.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='view of the marketplace' src={bailoMarketIcon} />
</Box>

Models marked as **Private** are excluded from the Marketplace and are only visible to users who have been explicitly
granted access.

## Finding models

Models can be discovered by:

- Using the search bar
- Filtering by tags

## Adding a model to the Marketplace

You can add a new model using either:

- The **Create** button on the Marketplace page, or
- The **Create** button in the application header

Creating a model requires completing three fields:

- **Model name**
- **Model description**
- **Visibility** (Public or Private)

Public models are visible to all users. Private models are only visible to users with the appropriate permissions,
configured in the model settings.

Once these fields are completed, the model is created and added to Bailo.

## Adding Model Card detail

After creating the model, you must select a **schema**. The selected schema defines the structure of the model card.

The model card captures important information such as:

- Intended use
- Training and evaluation details
- Known limitations or biases

Model card content can be updated over time as more information becomes available.

## Changing the Model Name or Description

To update the model name or description:

1. Open the model
2. Navigate to **Settings**
3. Edit the **Name** and/or **Description** fields

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
