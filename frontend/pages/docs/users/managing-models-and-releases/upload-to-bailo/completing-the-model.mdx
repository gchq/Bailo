# Completing the Model

Once your model has been uploaded and documented, it must be configured for review.

1. Open the model and navigate to the **Settings** tab.
2. Select **Model access** from the side menu.
3. Use the **Add a user or group to the Model access list** dropdown to add any additional users and/or groups to the
   model access.
4. Use the **Select roles** dropdown to choose the roles responsible for reviewing and approving the model.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='selecting user model roles' src={bailoModelAccess} />
</Box>

The selected roles will be notified when the model or its releases require review.

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
