# Uploading files

A file can be anything to do with the model data. This can be model binaries or other information that allows users of
Bailo to build and use your prepared models.

## Adding a file

Files are primarily uploaded using the ADD NEW FILES button located in a model's File Management tab. By pressing the
SELECT FILES button you are given the ability to choose files to upload. You can also adjust each file's associated
tags.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='view of files being uploaded' src={bailoUploadFile} />
</Box>

## Adding files to a new release

When creating a new release, you can also attach new and pre-existing files.

<br />

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='new release form with file attached' src={bailoUploadFileRelease} />
</Box>

## Adding files to an existing release

Similarly, you can upload and delete a file on an existing release by editing it.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='view of existing release with edit release button' src={bailoUploadedFileRelease} />
</Box>

## Uploading files programmatically

If you intend to download and use this in a notebook or other Python project you can use Bailo's Python Client. You can
find out how to do this [here](/docs/python/notebooks/models_and_releases_demo_pytorch/index.html).

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
