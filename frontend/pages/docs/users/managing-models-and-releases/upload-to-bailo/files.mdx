# Uploading files

A file can be anything to do with the model data. This can be model binaries or other information that allows users of
Bailo to build and use your prepared models.

## Adding files to a new release

Files are unique for each release. Therefore, if you decide to create a new release you can use the same file name, with
the updated parameters or information. In this example we will be adding `yolov4.onnx` to a new release.

<br />

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image src={bailoUploadFile} />
</Box>

## Adding files to an existing release

Similarly, you can upload and delete a file to an existing release by editing an existing release.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image src={bailoUploadedFile} />
</Box>

## Uploading files programmatically

If you intend to download and use this in a notebook or other Python project you can use Bailo's Python Client. You can
find out how to do this [here](/docs/python/notebooks/models_and_releases_demo_pytorch/index.html).

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
