# Uploading files

Files represent any artefacts related to a model, such as binaries, configuration files, or supporting documentation.
These files allow others to build, evaluate, and use your model.

## Adding files to a model

Files are uploaded from the **File Management** tab of a model.

1. Click **Add New Files**
2. Select files to upload
3. Optionally assign tags to each file

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='view of files being uploaded' src={bailoUploadFile} />
</Box>

## Adding files to a new release

When creating a new release, you can attach both newly uploaded files and files that already exist on the model.

<br />

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='new release form with file attached' src={bailoUploadFileRelease} />
</Box>

## Adding files to an existing release

Existing releases can be edited to add or remove files.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='view of existing release with edit release button' src={bailoUploadedFileRelease} />
</Box>

## Uploading files programmatically

To upload or download files programmatically, use the Bailo Python Client. Examples are available
[here](/docs/python/notebooks/models_and_releases_demo_pytorch/index.html).

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
