# Reviewed Access Requests

## What is an access request?

An access request grants permission to use a model hosted in Bailo.

## Who reviews access requests?

This can only be reviewed and approved by the **Model Senior Responsible officer**.

## Approval process

When an access request is created, the Model Senior Responsible Officer can either request changes or approve. Once
approved, the access request will be moved to **Archived**.

An example Python workflow is available [here](/docs/python/notebooks/access_requests_demo/index.html).

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
