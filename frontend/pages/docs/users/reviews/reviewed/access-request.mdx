## **What's an access request?**

An access request is to have access to a model that has been uploaded to Bailo.

## **How does the access request get reviewed ?**

This can only be reviewed and approved by the **_Model Senior Responsible officer_**.

## **Approval process and roles**

When an access request is created, the Model Senior Responsible Officer can either request for changes or approve. Once
approved, the access request will be moved to **_Archived_**

See [here](https://gchq.github.io/Bailo/docs/python/notebook/access_requests_demo) on how to do this in Python.
