# Reviewed Releases

## What is a release?

A release represents a specific version of a model. Multiple releases can exist for the same model, allowing changes
without affecting earlier versions.

## How are releases reviewed?

Release reviewers are assigned by the model owner, typically including:

- Model Technical Reviewer
- Model Senior Responsible Officer

See [Completing The Model](../../managing-models-and-releases/upload-to-bailo/completing-the-model) for details.

## Who can create a release?

Only the owner of the model can create releases.

## Approval process

When the Model Technical Reviewer and Model Senior Responsible Officer review a release, one or both will leave a
request for changes and/or approve. When approved by both roles, the release will be moved to **Archived**.

An example Python workflow is available [here](/docs/python/notebooks/models_and_releases_demo_pytorch/index.html).

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
