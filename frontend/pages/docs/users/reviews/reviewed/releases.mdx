## **What is a Release?**

A release is a different version of a model and there can be multiple released versions from the same model. Having a
release gives you the opportunity to make alterations, e.g. updates, adding new features etc, without affecting or
interfering with the original state of the model.

## **How are the Releases reviewed?**

Releases are reviewed by who the owner has chosen, to be the Model Technical Reviewer and the Model Senior Responsible
Officer. See [Completing The Model](../../managing-models-and-releases/upload-to-bailo/completing-the-model) for more
details.

## **Who can create one?**

Only the owner of the uploaded model can create a release.

## **Approval process and roles**

When the Model Technical Reviewer and Model Senior Responsible Officer review a release, one or both will leave a
request for changes and/or approve. When approved by both roles, the release will be moved to **_Archived_**.

See [here](/docs/python/notebooks/models_and_releases_demo_pytorch/index.html) on how to do this in Python.
