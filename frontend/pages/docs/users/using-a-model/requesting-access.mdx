## What is an Access Request?

In order to use a model you must first request access to the model. This is so that those managing the model can
authorise and keep tracking of anyone who wants to request access.

## How to make an Access Request

Visit the model overview page. From here you can click the "Request Access" button to create a new access request:

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image src={modelOverview} />
</Box>

Much like creating a model, access requests forms require a schema, this can be selected like so:

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image src={selectAccessRequestSchema} />
</Box>

Finally, fill out the form and submit your access request:

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image src={createAccessRequest} />
</Box>

## Review Process

Once this request has been approved by the necessary role you will be able to download Release artefacts and push docker
images.

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
