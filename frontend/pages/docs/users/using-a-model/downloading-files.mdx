## How to download files

Files are attached to model releases. You can download files from a release in one of two ways - by either finding the
release in the `Releases` tab and clicking the file download link:

<MigrationImageBehaviour src={releases} />

or alternatively, visiting the page for a specific release and clicking the file download link:

<MigrationImageBehaviour src={release} />

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
