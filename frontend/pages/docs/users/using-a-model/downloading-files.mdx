## How to download files

Files are attached to model releases. You can download files from a release in one of two ways.

By finding the release in the `Releases` tab and clicking the file download link:

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image src={releases} />
</Box>

By visiting the page for a specific release and clicking the file download link:

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image src={release} />
</Box>

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
