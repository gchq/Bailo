# Model Images

## Pushing a Docker image

Images can be pushed to the Docker registry attached to the hosted Bailo environment. These images can be assigned to
specific models so that they can be attached to releases. The steps on doing this will be detailed below, but can also
be found inside the UI on the registry of a model.

<Image src={registryTab} />

Clicking on the "Push Image" button will display a dialogue window that will make the process easier, but essentially
the process is:

- Create a token in the UI to make sure you have the correct Docker permissions (this will give you a secret key and an
  access key that will be used to authentication)
- Run the command `docker login <registryAddress> -u <accessKey>`
  - It will ask for a password, this is the secretKey property from the token you created earlier
- Run the command `docker tag <image> <registryAddress>/<modelId>/<imageName>:<tag>`
- Run the command `docker push <registryAddress>/<modelId>/<imageName>:<tag>`

## Using a pushed Docker image as part of a model release

Once you have pushed a Docker image to the registry it will be made available for use when drafting a model release. As
the image has been assigned to the model using the steps in the previous page, all you need to do is select the image
using the drop down on the release creating page like so:

<Image src={selectingAnImage} />

## Accessing an image

When an image is attached to a release, you will see them listed as part of the release display in the `Releases` tab on
the model page like so:

<Image src={ModelReleaseImageList} />

These paths can be copied for use in the following command:

`docker pull <imagePath>`

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
