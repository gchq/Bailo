# What is Bailo?

Bailo provides a **consistent**, **managed** platform for the machine learning lifecycle, enabling models to be deployed
in a **standardised** and **well orchestrated** way. This improves the use of ML models in operational contexts, and
does so in a **well controlled** and **low-risk** manner.

The service aims to:

- Providing a centralised repository for machine learning models
- Encourage discovery and reuse of existing models
- Standardise model packaging and deployment
- Enforce consistent compliance and review processes
- Support monitoring and governance of operational models

All of this documentation is available on
[our GitHub repository](https://github.com/gchq/Bailo/tree/main/frontend/pages/docs). Contributions and corrections are
welcome.
