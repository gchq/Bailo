# Isolated Environments

Bailo is built to be deployed on isolated environments, where access to the internet is strictly regulated. To install
Bailo on a segregated environment you will need the following dependencies.

## Helm Charts

We rely on the following [Bitnami charts](https://charts.bitnami.com/):

- MinIO https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
- MongoDB https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

## Docker Images

We rely on the following images:

- mongo:7.0.15
- bitnami/minio:2025.4.3
- marlonb/mailcrab:v1.5.0
- nginx:1.25.4-alpine3.18
- registry:3.0.0
- node:24.5.0-alpine

These will occasionally be updated. To retrieve the latest versions used, check `./compose.yaml` and
`./backend/Dockerfile`. These versions can be configured using the `tag` attribute for each image in `values.yaml` to
override the defaults. In general, keeping to the same major version will maintain compatibility with Bailo.

## NPM

We rely on many NPM packages. The full list is available in `package-lock.json`, `frontend/package-lock.json` and
`backend/package-lock.json`. Most are standard packages with the exception of:

- `sharp`, which is an optimised image transformer and requires some compilation tools.
- `cypress`, which is a user interface testing tool and requires a Chromium download.

`sharp` includes instructions on installing / building without internet [here](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install).
Instructions on installing `cypress` without internet are available
[here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/advanced-installation).
