## Bailo DataBase Migration Scripts

As Bailo develops, the requirements for storing data also change. Sometimes this will simply be adding a new property or
Document to MongoDB, and other times it will require migrating a collection of properties to a new object and
transforming them. This may mean updating the current data in MongoDB to match the new format, a process that requires a
migration script.

Bailo's migration scripts are stored in
[the backend migration directory](https://github.com/gchq/Bailo/tree/main/backend/src/migrations). Upon completion, a
script's name is stored as a Document in MongoDB under `bailo/migrations/`. This prevents any migration script being run
more than once.

Migrations that have been run by the backend can be viewed in the logs, for example:

```
...
backend-1  | info  - (src/clients/s3.ts:1): Ensuring uploads exists (bucket=uploads)
backend-1  | info  - (src/clients/s3.ts:1): Ensuring registry exists (bucket=registry)
backend-1  | info  - (src/utils/database.ts:1): Connected to Mongoose
backend-1  | info  - (src/clients/s3.ts:1): Bucket does not exist, creating uploads (bucket=uploads)
backend-1  | info  - (src/clients/s3.ts:1): Bucket does not exist, creating registry (bucket=registry)
backend-1  | info  - (src/utils/database.ts:1): Running migration 001_example.ts (file=001_example.ts)
backend-1  | info  - (src/utils/database.ts:1): Finished migration 001_example.ts (file=001_example.ts)
backend-1  | info  - (src/utils/database.ts:1): Running migration 002_update_model_kinds.ts (file=002_update_model_kinds.ts)
backend-1  | info  - (src/utils/database.ts:1): Finished migration 002_update_model_kinds.ts (file=002_update_model_kinds.ts)
backend-1  | info  - (src/utils/database.ts:1): Finished running all migrations

backend-1  | info  - (src/index.ts:1): Listening on port 3001
...
```

### Writing a migration script

Using [001_example.ts](https://github.com/gchq/Bailo/blob/main/backend/src/migrations/001_example.ts) as a template,
changes are typically made to the `up` function which is executed when the `backend` image is instantiated. Using
various Mongoose methods, the data in MongoDB is manipulated from some prior to state to match the new format.

### Updating previous migration scripts

Sometimes it is required to update an existing migration script, for example when a property is removed from a Model.
Care must be taken to update the existing migrations to work with the updated data structure(s) as well as the historic
data.

### Common gotchas

- Using `{lean: true}` in a `find` query returns POJOs (not Mongoose Documents) as per
  [the docs](<https://mongoosejs.com/docs/7.x/docs/api/query.html#Query.prototype.lean()>). The POJO does not have some
  commonly needed such as `save`, not getters/setters which are commonly used in migration scripts when working with
  properties that have been removed from a Document.
- Using `async forEach` loops in scripts is best avoided as the script will exit before the async function(s) have
  completed, resulting in the script being logged as succeeding when it has not yet finished, or potentially even failed
  due to an error. Instead, it is recommended to use a `for ... of` loop as recommended in
  [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37576787).
- Mongoose `Mixed` SchemaType requires an explicit `markModified` call as per
  [the docs](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/7.x/docs/schematypes.html#mixed) before calling `save`, otherwise changes to
  the `Mixed` property will not be saved.
