# App Configuration

## Configuration Files

> ⚠️ Note: If you use Helm this information does not apply to you. We use Helm to automatically configure the

Bailo uses [`node-config`](https://github.com/node-config/node-config#readme) for application configuration.
`node-config` organizes hierarchical configurations, allowing the user to set a series of overrides over a base
configuration.

The default set of configuration can be found in `config/default.js`, with overrides for other environments included in
the same folder. For production environments, configuration should be placed in either `production.cjs` or `local.js` to
override the default configuration.

The full order of configuration inheritance can be found
[on the node-config wiki](https://github.com/node-config/node-config/wiki/Configuration-Files).

## Configuration Specification

Please Refer to the following specification for details on setup and modification.

These are automatically updated with type documentation in our config at build time.

<Config />

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
