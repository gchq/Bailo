## Upload a Schema

By default Bailo comes with a default schema for both a model card and an access request. These are added on startup in
`backend/src/services/v2/schema.ts`. These contain a small number of questions, and are not expected to be used on a
production system.

To add a new schema, visit [/schemas/list](/schemas/list) on a Bailo instance. To manage schemas you will need to hold
the 'admin' role on the Bailo instance. Click the 'Upload a new Schema' button in the top left.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image src={bailoResetApprovals} />
</Box>

This will bring up a form to create a new schema. A description of each field is below:

| Field       | Description                                                                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Id          | A globally unique schema identifier, should include the schema version.                            |
| Name        | A user facing name for the schema, should include the schema version.                              |
| Description | This is displayed to the user to help them decide which schema to pick. This can include markdown. |
| Schema Type | Either 'Model' or 'Access Request'.                                                                |
| Schema      | Select a 'JSON Schema' that includes the questions you require.                                    |

From the schema list page you can also convert a schema to inactive by pressing the 'make inactive' button. If a schema
is deleted, any models associated with it will be deleted. Converting a schema to 'inactive' reduces it's priority
within the UI but does not break any existing models uploaded with it.

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
