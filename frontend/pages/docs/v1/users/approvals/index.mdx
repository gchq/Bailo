# Model Approvals

When you [upload a model](../upload-a-model/why-upload-a-model) to Bailo, it does not immediately become available to
deploy. Instead, it must first pass a series of compliance checks.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image src={bailoModelCompliance} />
</Box>

You can check the compliance state of any model by clicking on the 'Compliance' tab. Each item is coloured based on its
current status; 'green' represents passed, 'orange' for in progress and 'red' for failed. Compliance checks are split
into automatic (does the model build, is the model card supported) and manual (technical review, policy overview).

Manual reviews are split into two categories:

- Technical, reviewing the core code and model implementation
- Policy, reviewing the ethics, biases and other model card sections.

It is expected that reviews are handled outside of Bailo, using your usual corporate tools. When the review is complete,
the model can either be approved or declined from the [reviews](/review) page:

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image src={bailoReviews} />
</Box>

Email notifications, if configured, will be sent out when you are requested to review a model. Notifications are also
sent out to the model owner when a model has a review either approved or declined. If a review is declined, the model
can be updated by either editing the existing version or uploading a new version. Uploading a new version automatically
retriggers reviews. Reviews can be re-requested at any point using the 'Reset Approvals' model action:

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image src={bailoResetApprovals} />
</Box>

# Deployment Approvals

Deployment approvals follow the same pattern as model approvals. The differences are as follows:

- A deployment requires only one approval by the model owner, instead of two approvals from reviewers.
- A deployment is only built _after_ it has been approved, instead of immediately.
