## Marketplace

The Marketplace is the default landing page when you access Bailo. You can return to it from any other location in Bailo
by clicking the Marketplace icon:

<MigrationImageBehaviour src={bailoMarketplaceIcon} />

Models in Bailo are viewable in the Marketplace, with a search bar in the top-right to filter the list.

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
