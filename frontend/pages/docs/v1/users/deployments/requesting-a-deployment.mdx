# Requesting a Deployment

A deployment is required to use a model that has been uploaded to Bailo. To request a deployment, first go to the model
page and select 'Request deployment' from the actions menu.

<MigrationImageBehaviour src={bailoRequestDeployment} />

Fill out the deployment form. This can either be done by:

- Filling out the automatically generated UI
- Pasting the model deployment card directly into the 'Upload Existing' tab.

After submission, the model owner will need to approve your request before you are able to use the deployed model. To
approve a model, follow [the approvals process](../approvals/model-approvals).

After your model deployment has been approved, it will automatically be made available in the 'my deployments' tab.

<MigrationImageBehaviour src={bailoMyDeployments} />

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
