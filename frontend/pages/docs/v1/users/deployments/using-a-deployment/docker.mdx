# Docker Deployments

> _Please ensure that a deployment has gone through the [requesting](../requesting-a-deployment) and
> [compliance](../compliance) steps prior to using it._

Models that have been uploaded as either a Docker image or as a model binary are available from Bailo's internal Docker
store. This is compatible with a variety of Docker clients, including 'Kubernetes', 'Docker' and 'Podman'.

## Running a Deployed Docker image

Instructions and commands required to download and run a Docker image can be found by clicking "Show download commands"
from the deployment page.

<MigrationImageBehaviour src={bailoDockerDownloadCommands} />

Within Kubernetes and OpenShift, you must first create a secret containing your docker authentication before you can
pull images from Bailo. To do so, follow the
[kubernetes private registry instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/).

## Using a Deployed Docker image

When an image is run, it starts up a load balancer and multiple instances of your model that each expose a web API. This
API can either be consumed via gRPC or HTTP. More extensive documentation can be found
[on the Seldon Core page](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/reference/apis/v2-protocol.html). The
gRPC proto files can be found
[here](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/reference/apis/prediction.html#proto-buffer-and-grpc-definition).
You can also access an OpenAPI definition for a model by going to `<host>/seldon.json`.

The primary endpoint that can be used to make predictions on a model is the `/predict` endpoint. Send a `post` request
with your data included to infer a result. Examples include:

```sh
# curl
curl <host>/predict -d 'json={"jsonData":{"data":["some string data"]}}'
```

```python
# python
import requests
import json

headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
}

content = { "jsonData": { "data": ["some string data"] } }
data = f'json={json.dumps(content)}'

response = requests.post('<host>/predict', headers=headers, data=data)
```

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
