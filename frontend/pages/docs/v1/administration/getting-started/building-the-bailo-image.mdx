# Building the Bailo Image

Bailo does not provide pre-built images. Building one yourself is easy! Two images should be produced, one for the
frontend and one for the backend.

```bash
# Bailo uses a monorepo, so images should be built from the root directory
$ docker build -t "bailo-backend" -f ./backend/Dockerfile .
$ docker build -t "bailo-frontend" -f ./frontend/Dockerfile .
$ docker build -t "bailo-modelscan" -f ./lib/modelscan_api/Dockerfile .
```

Ensure you do not use the development Dockerfiles (called `Dockerfile.dev`) as they expect the application to be mounted
into them at a later point in time (to enable hot code reloading).

`docker` can be swapped out for any other OCI compliant container build platform. We routinely test with both `podman`
and `OpenShift Builder`. This image should be pushed to a registry that is accessible from your deployment target.
