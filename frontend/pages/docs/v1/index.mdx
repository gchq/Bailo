## What is Bailo?

The aim of the Bailo service is to provide a **consistent**, **managed** ecosystem of machine learning models that may
be deployed in a **standardised** and **well orchestrated** way. This will help to make greater use of ML models in
operational contexts, and do so in a well controlled and low risk manner.

In particular the objectives of the service include:

- Providing a centralised repository of ML models, where possible with models in standard formats
- Enabling users to find existing ML models, encouraging re-use of best practice and avoiding duplication of work
- Preparing models for deployment in a standard way
- Ensuring any deployed models are fully compliant, and that compliance rules are applied consistently from a single
  service
- Providing standardised monitoring approaches for operational ML models in order to identify issues and improvement
  opportunities.
