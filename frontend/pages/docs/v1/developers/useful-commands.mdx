# Useful Commands

## For your .bashrc file

```bash
# Aliases for Docker Compose (dc = docker compose)
alias dc="DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker compose"
alias dcp="DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml"


# Running scripts (rs = run script)
alias rs="npm run script --"
```

**Note** check your version of **`docker compose`**. If **`docker compose`** doesn't work for you then you may have
**`docker-compose`** installed instead, simply replace **`docker compose`** with **`docker-compose`**.

Once you've made these changes to your **`.bashrc`** file you'll need to run **`source ~/.bashrc`** to load in these
changes to the terminal

### Starting Bailo

Build images:

_You should only need to do this when dependencies have updated, e.g. changing branch / altering `package.json` /
running `npm install`._

```bash
dc build --parallel
```

Start up Bailo:

```bash
dc up -d
```

### Style Issues on GitHub Actions

```bash
npm run style
```

### Out of Space

_--volumes will also remove the contents of any volumes, e.g. Mongo / Minio. Removing it will remove all just remove
containers_

```bash
docker system prune -af --volumes
```

### Check Backend Logs

```bash
dc logs backend
```

Or to **F**ollow the logs

```bash
dc logs -f backend
```

### Registry Won't Start

You probably don't have certificates, the registry is the fastest to break with no certificates. Verify with:

```bash
dc logs registry
```

You should see a panic that includes some terms like 'ssl', 'certificates', or similar.

```bash
npm run certs
```

### PANIC

When all is lost and you just want to start over again... This command takes ~3 minutes to run, but resets everything
about your Bailo environment.

> _Run this from the root Bailo directory (e.g. `/home/ec2-user/git/Bailo`)_

**This will remove ALL data from Bailo.**

**Note** **`dc`** stands for docker compose. Please make sure you've completed the steps at the beginning of this file
before running these commands.

```bash
dc down --remove-orphans
rm -rf frontend/.next
rm -rf frontend/node_modules
rm -rf backend/node_modules
rm -rf node_modules
docker system prune -af --volumes
npm install
dc build --parallel
dc up -d
```

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
