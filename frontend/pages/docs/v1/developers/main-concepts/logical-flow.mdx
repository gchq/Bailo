1. A user accesses a URL. We use [NextJS routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction) to point it to a file in
   `pages`. `[xxx].tsx` files accept any route, `xxx.tsx` files allow only that specific route.
2. Data is loaded using [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/). Data loaders are stored in `./data`. Each one exposes variables
   to specify if it is loading, errored, data, etc.
3. Requests to the backend get routed through [express](https://expressjs.com/) within `backend/src/index.ts`. Each
   route is an array with all items being middleware except the last, which is the handler (`[...middleware, handler]`).
4. Routes interact with the database via `mongoose`, which stores models in `./backend/src/models`.

Some processing is done away from the main thread, when it is expected to take longer than a few milliseconds. These are
posted to a `mongodb` queue and processed by handlers in the `backend/src/processors` folder. Mongodb queues are handled
invisibly by `p-mongo-queue` (`backend/src/utils/queues.ts`).
