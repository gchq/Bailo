# Building Models

<MigrationImageBehaviour src={bailoFlowChartBuild} />

One of Bailo's responsibilities is turning a raw model into a packaged and productionised image for deployments. This
process differs based on packaging method and build environment, but is always controlled by the `BuildHandler`.

The `BuildHandler` takes a series of steps and handles running them, tidying up after or rolling back in the case of
failure. The `BuildHandler` is not responsible for retrying failed steps, which is handled by the underlying `Queue`.

Upon completion, the build is marked as complete and returned. In the case of a failure, the model will retry until the
retry limit is reached, where it will fail.

## Build Handler

The `BuildHandler` is constructed with a static series of steps to carry out:

```typescript
const buildHandler = new BuildHandler([
  { construct: exampleTaskA() },
  { construct: exampleTaskB() },
  { construct: exampleTaskC() },
])
```

Each `construct` is a function that takes in some options and returns a factory for an instantiated class extending
`BuildStep`. An example `construct` is:

```typescript
function exampleTaskA(opts: Partial<BuildOpts> = {}) {
  return (logger: BuildLogger, props: ExtractFilesProps) => {
    return new ExampleTaskA(logger, opts, props)
  }
}
```

A `BuildStep` represents a single unit of work. It needs a string `name`, used in the logs. It also needs a `build`
function to run the work and a `rollback` function in case of failure. An optional `tidyUp` function can be provided to
clean up after your operations.

```typescript
export abstract class BuildStep {
  constructor(logger: BuildLogger, opts: Partial<BuildOpts>, props: any) => BuildStep

  abstract name(version: VersionDoc, files: Files, state: any): Promise<string>
  abstract build(version: VersionDoc, files: Files, state: any): Promise<void>
  abstract rollback(version: VersionDoc, files: Files, state: any): Promise<void>

  // optional tidy up
  async tidyUp(_version: VersionDoc, _files: Files, _state: any): Promise<void> {}
}
```

A `BuildStep` also takes in props which can be provided when creating the `BuildHandler`:

```typescript
const buildHandler = new BuildHandler([
  { construct: createFolder(), props: { folderPath: '/tmp/a' } },
  { construct: buildModel(), props: { image: 'seldon3.6' } },
])
```

This can be used for configuring existing constructs. Once a `BuildHandler` is configured, it can be run by calling
`.process()`:

```typescript
await buildHandler.process(version, files)
```

`files` is used to reference to any build artefacts required by the build process. It is an object of named files, e.g:

```typescript
{
    binary: {
        path: "/binary.zip",
        bucket: "uploads",
        name: "binary.zip"
    },
    code: {
        path: "/code.zip",
        bucket: "uploads",
        name: "code.zip"
    }
}
```

## Seldon Core

Seldon Core is a framework that allows machine learning models to be run on orchestration platforms like Kubernetes and
OpenShift. It takes a model, a requirements files and an interface and returns a fully productionised Docker Image.

This Docker Image runs multiple model instances in parallel behind a load balancer to enable both fault tolerance as
well as performance improvements. It also provides both HTTP and GRPC interfaces as well as an OpenAPI specification to
document them.

We do not build images with SeldonCore on any platform. The default Seldon builder requires access to a Docker daemon
which either does not exist or we have disabled for security reasons on every production deployment we support.

Instead, when building an image we:

1. Configure `s2i` by creating a `.s2i/environment` file containing:

```bash
MODEL_NAME=Model
API_TYPE=REST
SERVICE_TYPE=MODEL
PERSISTENCE=0
PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=off
INCLUDE_METRICS_IN_CLIENT_RESPONSE=false
```

2. Run `s2i` with the `--as-dockerfile` tag, which forces it to only generate a `Dockerfile` and not attempt to build an
   image.

3. Build and push the generated `Dockerfile` using another tool. Currently supported include:
   - OpenShift Builder
   - img

## img

The default build tool for Bailo is [img](https://github.com/genuinetools/img). It mirrors the CLI syntax of `docker`
but runs as a standalone, daemonless and unprivileged executable.

## OpenShift Builder

We use OpenShift Builder when running within OpenShift, which by default disables certain system calls required by
`img`. This process currently comes with drawbacks, specifically:

- Unable to see live logs of models being built.
