# Unit Testing

Bailo makes use of the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) library for unit testing. It is popular, robust and widely documented.

## File structure

Instead of using a dedicated testing directory, all unit tests should go in the same directory as the component that is
being tested. File names should also correspond to their associated component, with the word 'spec' added before the
file extension. For example, if you have a component called 'HelloWorld.tsx', its unit test would be
'HelloWorld.spec.tsx'.

## Running the tests

In order to check that your tests work locally, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Or if you would like to test a specific component:

```bash
npm run test /path/to/MyComponent.spec.tsx
```

## Examples

Below is a very simple example of a unit test for a React component.

```typescript
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react'
import EmptyBlob from './EmptyBlob.js'

describe('EmptyBlob', () => {
  it('renders an EmptyBlob component with the text of string', async () => {
    render(<EmptyBlob text='string' />)
    await waitFor(async () => {
      expect(await screen.findByText('string')).not.toBeUndefined()
    })
  })
})
```

In the above example we describe which component is being tested and then state the nature of an individual test, in
this case, checking whether it has rendered or not. It is important that the comment at the top of the test is kept in
as this is used for Jest to run tests in the Node test environment.

The aptly named `render()` function is called to render the component that needs to be tested (in this case,
EmptyBlob.tsx), from there we can make use of `screen` to find aspects of the rendered component and test for their
existence and / or displayed properties. When rendering components it is vital that any providers or wrappers that the
component relies on will need to surround the component being tested, just as if it were to be rendered in the
application itself.
